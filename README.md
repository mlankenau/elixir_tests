# ElixirTests

My first elixir tests and experiments. There is no context, I am just playing with the language....

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add elixir_tests to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:elixir_tests, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure elixir_tests is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:elixir_tests]]
        end
